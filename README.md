# Cucumber-bdd Framework

This project implements an automated testing framework using Cucumber, java, and RestAssured, integrated with Maven. The framework follows Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) principles, enabling you to test API services.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this framework is to automate  API testing using the Cucumber BDD approach. It includes:

- **Cucumber for BDD tests**: Cucumber helps to define tests in Gherkin syntax and integrates them with Java step definitions.
- **RestAssured for API testing**: Used for testing RESTful APIs.
- **JUnit for test execution**: Tests are executed using JUnit.
- **Maven for project management and dependency management**.

- ### Key Features

- BDD-style test scenarios for API testing.
- REST API tests using RestAssured with validation of the response structure.
- Automated  tests for front-end functionality.
- Integration with Cucumber reporting tools (JSON and HTML formats).

- ### Prerequisites
